Regional Logistics Report
Purpose: Analyze logistics performance by region.
Metrics:
Total inbound and outbound quantities by region (region in province table).
Pullback quantities by region.
Visuals:
Map visualization of logistics performance by region.
Bar chart of inbound and outbound quantities by region.


Here’s how to approach building the **Regional Logistics Report** in Power BI, step by step, based on your schema and your report description:

---

## 1. **Data Model & Relationships**
- Connect:
  - `shop[province_id]` → `province[id]`
  - `inbound[shop_code]` and `outbound[shop_code]` → `shop[shop_code]`
  - `pullback[from_shop]` or `pullback[to_shop]` → `shop[shop_code]`
- Use `province[region]` as the key for regional analysis.

---

## 2. **Key Measures (DAX)**

**Total Inbound Quantity by Region**
```DAX
Total Inbound by Region = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(inbound[box_qty]),
    ALLEXCEPT(province, province[region])
)
```

**Total Outbound Quantity by Region**
```DAX
Total Outbound by Region = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(outbound[box_qty]),
    ALLEXCEPT(province, province[region])
)
```

**Total Pullback Quantity by Region**
```DAX
Total Pullback by Region = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(pullback[box]),
    ALLEXCEPT(province, province[region])
)
```
*(You may need to use RELATED or LOOKUPVALUE to connect pullback shops to province/region if not directly related.)*

---

## 3. **Visuals**

- **Map Visualization:**  
  - Location: Use province or region (or use latitude/longitude if available at province level)
  - Size/Color: Total inbound, outbound, or pullback quantities
  - Tooltip: Show region and quantities

- **Bar Chart:**  
  - Axis: `province[region]`
  - Values: Total inbound and outbound quantities (as series)

---

## 4. **Slicers/Filters**
- By region, province, or date (if needed).

---

## 5. **Tips**
- Ensure all relationships are set up in the Power BI model.
- Use tooltips for more details on the map.
- You can use stacked or clustered bar charts for easy comparison between inbound and outbound.

**Summary Table for Your Report**

| Visual Type | Axis/Location      | Value(s)                  | Filter/Slicer         |
|-------------|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| Map         | Region/Province    | Inbound, Outbound, Pullback | Region, Province      |
| Bar Chart   | Region             | Inbound, Outbound         | Region, Province      |
