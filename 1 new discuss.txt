* **Purpose**: Detect high-defect suppliers or products to reduce quality issues.
* **Key fields**: `defect.defect_qty`, `inbound.input_standard`, `item_list.barcode`, `brand_code`, `purchase_order_num`
* **KPI**: Defect Rate = Total Defect Qty / Total Received Qty

#### 3. **Stock Movement Summary**

* **Purpose**: Track movement (inbound, outbound, pullback) per shop or brand over time.
